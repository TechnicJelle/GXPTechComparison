# GXP Tech Comparison
For my "Advanced Tools" course at Saxion CMGT.

## Evaluation proposal
I want to compare the (graphics) performance of
 Legacy OpenGL paired with (Windows) System.Drawing running on .NET Framework 4.8,
 with Modern OpenGL paired with SkiaSharp running on .NET 7 or 8.

The former is the technology currently used in the GXP Engine,
the latter is the technology we're interested in using for NeoGXP.
